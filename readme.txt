This is a mini project where some basic operations of bank like deposit, withdraw and other functions are performed using java.

Here I tried to use most of the basic concepts of java. It has 2 packages namely: BankApp and DisplayPack.

In BankApp we have different classes which performs different operations.
In class Bank we have declared the global variables and used the construtors.
BankInt is an Interface where we have declared 3 different functions which are used in other classes.
In class CurrentAcc, JointAcc and SavingsAcc, we have used these functions and performed different operations.
In class InvalidAmountException we have called a customised exception.
In class BankInt we have defined those customised exception.

In Package DisplayPack we have one class namely TestBank where all other classes of BankApp package is imported.
Also a thread is implemented here to delay the display for 1 second
